- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Barrys-B
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m 73 years old and as now retired I worked with Computers since 1987.
- Started with CP/M Turbo-Dos, went to MS-Dos and Windows and later on to Unix/Linux.
- started programming in BASIC a bit Forth and now I try to do C and C++.
- I bought a RASPERI-PI  and try to do it with Python.
- But depending on my age I'm only trying ;-)
- keep on going, Barry-B
